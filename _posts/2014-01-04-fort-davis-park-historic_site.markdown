	Fort Davis National Historic Site, along Texas Highways 17 - 118 at the foot of Sleeping Lion Mountain and Hospital Canyon, is considered perhaps the best preserved of all the 19th Century frontier forts and one of the best preserved "Buffalo Soldier" forts in the west. The site is well maintained and thoughtfully restored with interpretive and historical displays, an excellent book shop and a museum. Partially restored and fully restored buildings are scattered throughout the 523 acre grounds. Some have period furnishings. Military hobbyists and historians from all over the country visit the Davis Mountains specifically to see the Fort. Three hiking trails climb from the Fort, with two links to the hiking trail at Davis Mountains State Park. Small plaques explain natural features and their value to the Fort when it was active. Self guided tours daily. Admission is $3 per person. Hours are 8:00am to 5:00pm.
