	 <p>This converted filling station, smartly decked out in black, white, and red, would not look out of place in New York. Except for the crust on the pizza, which is much thicker than you find in the Big Apple. That said, it turns out a mean pie, especially the garden herb, which is similar to a margherita. In addition to basil, cheese, and tomatoes, the pizza is dotted with green onions (that have a tendency to roll right off). Don’t imagine you’ll end up with leftovers.
