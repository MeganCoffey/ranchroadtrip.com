  <p>Started in October of 2004 as an idea for a simple juice bar developed into a sandwich shop offering juices, smoothies, creamsicle sodas and shakes with customized vitamin supplements. 

    Daily vegetarian soup, bratwurst, hummus with pita bread, garden salads and breakfast options including Birchermüesli – a hearty Swiss recipe of oats, fruit and yogurt, a vegan granola dish with açai, waffles and freshly baked croissants.

    With a focus on fresh, healthy offerings, it’s an eclectic menu sure to cater to almost any palate.
    We are located right across from the historic Presidio Courthouse.  Driving Range
