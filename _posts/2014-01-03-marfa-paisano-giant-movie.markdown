    	The Hotel Paisano’s GIANT memorabilia room offers gift and souvenir items related to the movie and cast. Items such as James Dean t-shirts, Elizabeth Taylor note cards, copies of the novel by Edna Ferber and the Warner Brothers anniversary edition DVD, and recreations of the original key tags with the actors’ name and room number are all available for purchase.

    	“… there is a special room of memorabilia where one can even sit down and watch the movie.”

      ”Giant” is a 1956 United States|American drama film, directed by George Stevens from a screenplay adapted by Fred Guiol and Ivan Moffat from the novel by Edna Ferber. The film stars Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean and features Carroll Baker, Jane Withers, Chill Wills, Mercedes McCambridge, Dennis Hopper, Sal Mineo, Rod Taylor, Elsa Cardenas and Earl Holliman. ”Giant ” was the last of James Dean’s three films as a leading actor, and earned him his second and last Academy Award nomination; he was killed in a car accident before the film was released. Nick Adams (actor) was called in to do some voice-over dubbing for Dean’s role.

    	In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant”.
