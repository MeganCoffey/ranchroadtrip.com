          <h3>By Air</h3>
          <p>Fly to El Paso or Midland and then drive 3 hours to Marfa. Although, it makes for a long day, the drive offers an inviting glimpse of the desolate, yet stunningly beautiful landscape. From El Paso, you’ll pass the Lucchese cowboy-boot outlet, the town of Valentine, and the Prada Marfa art installation — a faux store once stocked with shoes smack in the middle of nowhere. The drive from Midland is about the same, but less entertaining. FYI: El Paso is on Mountain Time while Marfa is on Central Time. You will gain or lose an hour during this ride.

          <em>Rental Cars:</em>
          We’ve been advised to recommend that you book your rental car as early as possible as they can be hard to come by.

          <em>Shuttle Options:</em>
          The Marfa Flyer and West Texas Flyer provide a way to get to and from either of these airports. They seem to be owned by the same person.

          <h3>By Ground</h3>

          <p>Coming from the east, take I-10 west for hours. Set the cruise control and don’t expect too many turns. There’s two routes you can take from I-10, they’re about the same time-wise. Highway 17 through Fort Davis winds through Limpia Canyon and the Davis Mountains, providing a first-hand view of the terrain unique to West Texas. Highway 67 through Alpine to Highway 90 to Marfa provides an open road with mountainous scenery in the distance.

          Coming from the west, take I-10 to Highway 90. Plan your fuel stops wisely, as it’s possible to go almost 200 miles between cities.</p>
